# Incomes and Impact on Communicable Diseases

## Project Overview

This project took a look at the impact that income had on communicable diseases. I wanted to see how different income levels correlated with the impact that communicable diseases had on different locations on a global scale. I used several different datasets to help me clean and filter the data, create visualizations, and then train using machine learning. 

## Self Assessment and Reflection

I really enjoyed this project and got the chance to explore a topic that I am relatively passionate about. I already had an idea of how the data would look, but it was interesting to see just how strongly they correlated with one another. It also allowed me to use the knowledge and different things I have picked up from this class to interpret the data. 

### Self Assessment

| Category          | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **Setup**         | 10 / 10 |
| **Execution**     | 20 / 20 |
| **Documentation** | 10 / 10 |
| **Presentation**  | 30 / 30 |
| **Total**         | 70 / 70 |

### Reflection

#### What went well?
- I think most things went well for me. I honestly think the hardest part for me was finding a topic that was interesting and I would be able to find good data for. I tried a few different project ideas but I struggled mostly to find good data. 
#### What did not go well?
- I struggled the most with the machine learning section of my project. I wasn't able to get my code working for awhile or wasn't getting the prediction I was expecting. It took awhile and some changes to get it working well.
#### What did you learn?
- I learned a lot while working on this project. I feel that I was able to implement a lot of the different techniques and knowledge we have learned throughout the semester on one project. It was interesting to build a project from the begging to the end. 
#### What would you do differently next time?
- I don't know if I would do anything in particular different. I struggled a lot to find good data when I was starting out so going to better sources first would probable be it!

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
