    "Looking at water pollution and its impact on health and well being. Analyzing different pollutants and health problems could help to provide some insight into how they correlate with one another. Clean water is becoming more scarce each year and more pollutants are impacting water sources. With a lack of regulations and water pollution being commonplace, it will be important to understand the impact of water pollution on health in order to draw sufficient attention and funding to cleanups. Addressing water pollution is critical to saving lives across the globe and this problem will only continue to grow each year as the problem continues."

I plan to relate these data sets mostly through the location that the tests are done at. This will allow me to correlate a particular pollutant with a trent of water related health risks in an area. There are also particular data sets from the WHO that focus on particular data attributed to human health risks that I can use to verify / as a starting point for other data. \n",

    "This project is quite complex. There are a lot of different pollutants and data sets that are involved with water quality. Since I will be looking at different water pollutants and health problems, the best way to indicate correlation will be location. The datasets have location tied into them, with WHO datasets listing particular health problems attributed with water pollution. The location will allow me to tie different water related health problems with their location and overall water quality. Hopefully, I will be able to see patterns of higher polluted/contaminated areas with increased health risks in particular areas. Furthermore, I can compare different datasets in order to determine how different pollutants impact different health conditions. I will hopefully be able to create charts to help visualize the data between the different datasets in order to draw meaningful conclusions. "
