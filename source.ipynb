Breaking down the Income and Disease numbers could help to provide some insight into how they correlate with one another. Diseases can become a very big problem very quickly. We got to see this play out during the chaos when Covid-19 was spreading around. Analyzing the impact between income and infections could hopefully draw more attention to situations like what happened with Covid-19. Addressing the spread of diseases is critical to saving lives across the globe and this problem will only continue to grow as diseases adapt and evolve overtime."
