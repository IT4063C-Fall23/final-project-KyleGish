    "Looking at the spread of diseases is crucial to helping improve human health and well beings. Breaking down the Income and Disease numbers could help to provide some insight into how they correlate with one another. Diseases can become a very big problem very quickly. We got to see this play out during the chaos when Covid-19 was spreading around. Analyzing the impact between income and infections could hopefully draw more attention to situations like what happened with Covid-19. Addressing the spread of diseases is critical to saving lives across the globe and this problem will only continue to grow as diseases adapt and evolve overtime. \n"

I want to focus on covid data first as it is very relevant but also a bit different than other diseases. Then I wanted to focus on a few other diseases such as cholera, HIV, or tuberculosis.
